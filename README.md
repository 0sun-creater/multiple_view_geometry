## Demo on how to calculate epipolar line

### Given: 
* The two camera positions in world frame, 
* The position of the cube in world frame, 
* The camera intrinsics

### Then:
* Calculate the projection of the keypoints from the cube onto the image frame
* Calculate the epipolar line in each image using its coorespondence and essential matrix
